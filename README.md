# üí∞ Smart Daily Expense Tracker

## App Overview
A modern Kotlin Multiplatform expense tracking application built with Compose Multiplatform, targeting both Android and iOS platforms. The app enables small business owners to efficiently track daily expenses with categories like Staff, Travel, Food, and Utility, featuring real-time analytics, export capabilities, and a clean Material Design 3 interface.

## AI Usage Summary
This project was developed with extensive AI assistance using Cascade (Windsurf AI assistant). AI was utilized for:
- Complete project architecture design and Kotlin Multiplatform setup with Room KMP database integration
- Full UI implementation using Compose Multiplatform with MVVM architecture and Koin dependency injection
- Debugging and resolving complex multiplatform compatibility issues, including platform-specific implementations for iOS/Android
- Creating comprehensive business logic for expense management, filtering, reporting, and data export functionality
- Troubleshooting build configuration issues, dependency conflicts, and iOS framework compilation problems

## Key Development Prompts
```
1. "Create a Smart Daily Expense Tracker using Kotlin Multiplatform targeting Android and iOS. 
   Include expense entry, list management, and reporting features with Room database integration."

2. "Implement MVVM architecture with Compose Multiplatform UI, Koin dependency injection, 
   and proper navigation between expense entry, list, and reports screens."

3. "Set up Room KMP database with proper entity relationships, DAO operations, and 
   multiplatform compatibility for both Android and iOS targets."

4. "Create dedicated Android application module structure since composeApp should be 
   a shared library, not a runnable application."

5. "Fix iOS build compilation errors by implementing platform-specific solutions for 
   String.format(), System.currentTimeMillis(), and Koin ViewModel compatibility."

6. "Resolve navigation library dependency conflicts and cache build failures for 
   iOS framework generation in Xcode."
```
